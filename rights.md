Goods vs Rights and Business vs Nonprofit

To be able to analyze complex things of the real world, we need to split all resources of our civilization into two categories: goods and rights.

Characteristics of goods:

* Goods cost money to produce every item.
* Goods can be owned by a business, usually in potentially unlimited quantities.
* Goods can be moved between persons and/or organizations.

Characteristics of rights:

* Rights should belong to everybody.
* Rights are not a part of the industrial economy.
* Rights are often tied to an individual human or an individual organization and are often not transferable.
* It is hard to impossible or impractical to sell rights.

There is no exact border between goods and rights: Is bread a good or right? It costs money to produce, it can be owned by a business in unlimited quantities, it is a part of the industry (including agriculture), but it should belong to everybody.

My main claim: Rights should be free!

In this article I profoundly prove that to open a business or nonprofit, defend a right in a court, receive an ID card, opening a bank account, etc. should be free (exactly $0).

These things are to be counted rights, not goods. It is a middle-age madness when a state takes money to open a business or to provide an ID card.

Goods are usually produced and sold by a business. Business is relatively good in producing goods. We learned that market economy is the best known method to produce goods, because as we know socialism mostly failed.

But it is madness when rights are trusted to a business to be sold for money. It is even a greater madness if a state sells rights for money, as if it would not have income tax and value added tax. It is like a billionaire stealing a cent from a beggar (that writes a free software for his business) because he wants to make his business more effective.

Even businesses understand they need to provide free services or free trials to be more effective. The state authorities need psychiatrists: they sell rights for money.

Why rights are so important? Because they are like 1000 times more effective than goods today. The number 1000 times is estimated from expenses and advantages of a particular project, the Linux project:

In 2008 the value of developing a Linux distribution was worth $10.8 billion. But only Red Hat Enterprise Linux to Impact $10 Trillion of Global Business Revenues in 2019. Obviously Linux impact is many tens trillions dollars.

We see about 1000 fold or much more impact of a nonprofit project. It is partly because Linux is more like a right than a good, and yes, because it is free.

We see here an example of a right partly developed by a nonprofit (Linux Foundation). Here we switch to the next topic: goods are associated with business, rights are associated with state and nonprofit.

As I said, business is relatively good (I mean better than socialism) in producing goods. Business sometimes produces rights (often bearing heavy burden of expenses to produce them with only a little or no benefit back for the company). But the natural order of things is when rights are produced by nonprofit (or by state, which is somehow like a big nonprofit concerning its citizens).

If the natural order breaks and rights are not produced or distributed for free, we have such problems as:

* People in poverty.
* Economic recession or stagnation.
* Unjust world.
* Need to choose to produce a good/right or to distribute it. It is often not enough to money/time/resources to do both.
* Failed important projects.
* Other.

Scientists do not receive proper reward for the work they do. Journalists live mostly on ads, as if their work would be so unimportant to deliver them only a little share of their job benefits. Free software authors are sometimes poor and have no money to advertise their products. Etc. This is partly from not understanding by the establishment the difference between goods and rights, they tend to think that rights are also a part of market economy and to be sold for money or just ignored if they can’t be sold, what is very wrong.

The more world economy and technology develops, the more important rights become (for example, because software needs to be a free right rather than a good to be technically effective). Capitalism with its focus on goods is a too ancient system now. We need an economy that more and more focuses on rights. It is partly because now people have more goods than in the past and so goods loses their importance.

As rights become more important, nonprofits that exist to produce them (yes, the very purpose of nonprofits is to produce and distribute rights) become more important, too.

Capitalism is the business-based economy. We need nonprofit-based economy. I have a proposal for some solution: Use technologies of CryptoNGO to support nonprofits with crypto. CryptoNGO gives every signing up nonprofit project an infinite amount of a cryptocurrency, limited only by the nonprofit purpose and obligations, to make rights unlimited.

The next thing to discuss is human rights. Every human should really have rights. We all know that just to distribute everything for free does not work (especially because people are greedy). But to sell rights for money is a big no. Both variants don’t work. What to do? We should distribute some rights (e.g. the right to open a bank account or the right to install an operating system such as Linux for free), we should sell some rights for crypto rather than for money.

The idea is simple: Give every person 1 coin of some specifically created crypto every 0:00 every day. (Need to decide if from the moment of his or her signup in the system or from the moment of the setup of the system or from the moment of his or her birth, etc. I do not know the best way to set the moment this stream of crypto starts to flow.) Then such rights as to have some bread or to be heard in media could be sold for this free crypto rather than to be given for free or to be sold for money. It is a golden middle, better than both extremes to give everyone free money or free goods or to force everybody to pay for rights.

The most troublesome thing to set this system is to check that one human person does not signup more than once. To do this one needs to set a system to check his personal ID reliably. We need money to do this checking in some way. Signup at CryptoNGO and create your own nonprofit to accomplish this project! I would help you with programming tasks for free.

I will write more about the proposed nonprofit to give crypto to every human later.

Media coverage of a person’s ideas should be partly considered a right. It is very bad if a porn star has an advantage over a mathematician in media coverage. It is bad when somebody becomes a moral teacher because he stole more money than others to cover his media expenses. Everybody should have the right not only to say but to be heard. The human crypto could be a partial solution of this problem: We should sell media coverage or ads for this crypto as well, not only for money.
